# Sisu [Affective Agent]
Sisu is a gamified learning application designed to assist school-aged children who are struggling to read. Sisu utilizes readily-available technology to promote learning at home, with unique elements tied to the learning experience: (1) a spelling game with (2) an empathic agent, and (3) a mini-game. The empathic agent utilizes a facial action coding system (FACS) to recognize core expressions of the child user and respond to the child’s affect in-game. We anticipate that Sisu’s accessible and affective nature will not only support children’s emotional needs, but the addition of gamified elements will motivate them to practice reading and assist them in their learning objectives
